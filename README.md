This project is created using create-react-app
I have tried to keep the code easy to understand by creating separate components and different pages.

## Run Project
Run the following command after cloning/downloading the directory

$ npm install 
or
$ npm i

And then on your command line run the following script 

$ npm start

## NOTE
I have tried to create the UI exactly as the given in the video. It may not be exactly the same, because more than 
pictures and components i have tried to focus on the features and functionalities. And tried to match them to the given assignment.
